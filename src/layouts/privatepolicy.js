    often be subject to confidentiality or privacy obligations, they may not
    always follow the particular requirements of the Australian Privacy Act.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, we require that organisations outside BB&amp;B, who handle or
    obtain personal information as service providers to BB&amp;B, acknowledge
    the confidentiality of this information and undertake to comply with the
    Privacy Principles under Australian law.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>How do we manage personal information?</em></strong>
    <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    BB&amp;B trains all its employees to handle personal information and
    respect the confidentiality of that information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>How do we store personal information?</em></strong>
    <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    BB&amp;B is required, by the Principles, to safeguard the security and
    privacy of your information, whether you interact with us personally, by
    telephone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. This
    includes an obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal
    information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or
    disclosure. We hold information on our premises and with the assistance of
    our service providers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Principles also require BB&amp;B not to store personal information
    longer than necessary and to take reasonable steps to destroy that personal
information or remove details which may identify individuals.    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    BB&amp;B stores personal information at its own premises and with the
    assistance of its service providers. BB&amp;B maintains strict procedures
    and standards and takes a range of steps to prevent unauthorised access to,
    or disclosure of, personal information and protect an individual’s
    information from misuse or loss. Once an individual’s information is no
    longer needed by BB&amp;B, reasonable steps are taken to destroy or
    de-identify it.
